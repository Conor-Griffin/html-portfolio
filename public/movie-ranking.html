<h1>The best movies according to Conor</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Incredibles</h3>
<p>Favourite from childhood, dash figuring out he could run on water was the best scene</p>
<h3>Limitless</h3>
<p>Inspiring and cool to imagine what the human mind is really capable of, relate to it with ADHD and taking adderall</p>
<h3>The Avengers</h3>
<p>Greatest superhero movie of all time, the team up of all the best superheroes was amazing</p>
